            <p>This project by Niki Ito was created as a part of the Google Summer of Code 2021. Niki is an artist,
                designer, and beginner-coder. With guidance from her mentors Elgin-Skye McLaren and Grace Kwon, Niki
                developed her project titled “Activism Through Storytelling with Code.” The project includes this
                website “about Me, You, & Us,” a Project Handbook, and a GitHub Repository. </p>

            <h4><a class="links" href="handbook/index.html">Handbook</a></h4>
            <p>The handbook is a friendly guide on how Niki created “about Me, You, & Us.” It mainly focuses on the
                conceptual process and the coding process for non-coders and beginner-coders. The handbook will act as a
                step-by-step documentation for other artists, designers, activists, and coders to work on their own
                creative project. </p>

            <h4><a class="links" href="https://github.com/niki-ito/Codeing">GitHub Repository</a></h4>
            <p>The GitHub repository includes all of the project files and the file’s revision history. The project
                files include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for this website, the handbook, and a readme page which
                describes the project and includes links to the websites. </p>
