                        <h4>Conceptual</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="key-dropdown__bold">Find my own way of Activism</span>
                                <p>I realized that it was important for me to find my own way of activism and helping the
                                    community. Activism that is on the front-line and works directly with associated
                                    organizations may have a more significant outcome but I felt that I was personally drawn
                                    to actions that were more personal. Such as, an action of sharing Individual stories and
                                    building intimate relationships to understand and advocate for a larger cause. Through
                                    being honest with my interest and comfort-level, I was able to find opportunities and
                                    build relationships that came more naturally to me.</p></li>
                            <li><span class="key-dropdown__bold">Receive advice from people you look up to</span> 
                                <p>I found that it is important to have open conversations with people I trust and admire
                                    to support and nurture my project. It was my first community-based and collaborative
                                    project. I often felt lost and confused about my purpose and strategies. I realized that
                                    I think more clearly through open dialogue with others. Having the right people to talk
                                    to was one of my biggest motivators to developing my project.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Technical</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="key-dropdown__bold">Develop troubleshooting steps</span>
                                <p>I have developed a series of troubleshooting strategies. When you are stuck with a
                                coding issue in your p5.js sketch, first check the console for any error messages. If
                                you don’t understand what they mean, it helps to look them up on the internet and in
                                most cases, other people have experienced the same issue. Due to my lack of experience,
                                at times I would find it tricky to even understand the solutions that were posted. I
                                would do as much as I can on my own but if I still have trouble, I would ask my mentor
                                or other experienced coders and I found that there are no issues that cannot be solved.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><span class="key-dropdown__bold">Document coding issues and contribute to open-source</span>
                                <p>I learned that it is important to keep track of the issues I’ve had and make a record of
                                what happened, what appeared in the console, and how I fixed it. I used <a href="https://github.com/niki-ito/activism-through-storytelling-with-code/issues/2" target="_blank">GitHub issues</a> to
                                create these posts which can also contribute to open-source and help others solve
                                similar problems.</p>
                                </li>
                            <li><span class="key-dropdown__bold">Learn to organize and explain your code</span>
                                <p>It was a challenge to program while keeping in mind that it should be easy for others to
                                understand. As a beginner, the code could often be long, tedious, and confusing to
                                understand. In open-source programming, learning to code not only for yourself but for
                                others is an important skill to develop.</p>
                                </li>
                            <li><span class="key-dropdown__bold">Utilize GitHub</span>
                                <p>I enjoyed using GitHub to store, record, and host my project and websites. I had no idea
                                what GitHub was for at the beginning of this project. In time, I learned how to create
                                project repositories, post issues, create branches, record project histories, and host
                                my website for free with GitHub pages. It is a great way to be a part of the programming
                                community and learn while contributing to open-source and sharing your work with others.</p>
