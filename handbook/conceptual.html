                        sentiment and misunderstandings. I sought to create more intimate and personal connections
                        between people to cultivate further understanding and compassion.</p>

                                American
                                experience.</span>
                            <p>I realized that even though I have seen documentaries and
                                read books about Asian
                                Americans, knowing of their experiences and truly understanding them were two different
                                things. Even though it is obvious that I would not know what it is like to be Chinese
                                American for example, I sometimes had forgotten how different our lives and perspectives
                                were. Especially as an international student who is just visiting the U.S, it was not
                                until I actively immersed myself in Asian American communities that I realized just how
                                much I was different. Not only is "Asian American" a very large group of people but I
                                also found it tricky to curate my project to include groups of people that I had yet to
                                understand. Although it would be a nice challenge to try and include various cultural
                                groups of Asian Americans, I felt that I was limited in time and connections.</p><br>

                            <p>Realizing my level of understanding and the position that I
                                am in led me to be more
                                continuous about what specific group of people I would be representing in my project. At
                                first, I discussed my project with as many people as I could but it wasn’t until I
                                contacted a closer friend of mine Miwa Neishi, that I was able to finally start molding
                                my project. I ended up building my project from a closer and more familiar space. This
                                led to my project focusing more on the Japanese diaspora in the U.S. In this way, I was
                                able to better understand and curate my project.</p>

                            <p>My first plan was to interview an old Chinese-owned store in
                                Chinatown. I had contacted them before my project had started but received no answers.
                                After some waiting, I realized that they must be very busy and I should move on to
                                another plan. Since this project has a timeline, it was important to have flexibility so
                                that I could start coding and building the project. After changing my plan from
                                interviewing one subject/entity to recording conversations between two people, I
                                continued to have issues when planning to get in touch with people. Some people were
                                interested but did not have time and others would not stay in touch. </p><br>

                                interested in my project but was able to make time and contribute to my project. Since
                                my plan was always in the process of molding into something better, she had a
                                significant role in shaping my project into what it is today. I met her through this
                                project and now we have a great lasting friendship. </p>

                            <p>To advocate against anti-Asian sentiments, I wanted to focus
                                on intimate and authentic ways I can share narratives. I wanted to avoid boxing in my
                                subjects to serve my own purpose. In other words, I did not want to project my own
                                expectations on them. Especially since I am not a specialist in interviews, activism, or
                                racism, I thought that I should not be the one to ask specific questions. </p><br>

                            <p>This allowed me to collect narratives that are more natural
                                and free-flowing. It was also interesting to see how different a conversation could feel
                                depending on who people were paired with. I felt that in this way, the conversations
                                were shaped more by the things they usually think about rather than What I made them
                                think about. </p>

                                Showcase (zoom event), Mural Unveiling and Seeding Rituals (demonstrative march): It was
                                an amazing experience to be able to join and see how the community shares, educates, and
                                brings people together. In these events I was able to feel connected, supported, and a
                                part of the community as well as realize significant differences between the Chinese
                                American community and myself as a Japanese immigrant. </li>
                            <li>Reading “Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning” by Cathy Park Hong:
                                If I am honest, I am a very slow reader and I am still in the process of finishing this
                                book. With that said, I really like that the book includes historical events that
                                represents racism and discrimination but also intimate and personal events. The book
                                feels very intimate but also covers larger and more general topics.

                                professor and friends who were a part of the Asian community in the United States.
                                Although at times it was not only to talk about this project, it was nice to bring it up
                                and have them open up about their experiences living in the U.S. My professor Sherry

                        projects and documentation. During this project, I was constantly communicating with people to
                        receive feedback and go through my thought process. Not only did it help me organize my thoughts

                            anything that would make a difference, the act of trying and being more thoughtful of
                            concepts helped me see what is possible. I believe that this project has helped me overcome
                            a barrier that had stopped me from creating more meaningful, personal, and community-based
                            works out of fearing what others might think or if it would be enough. This experience has
                            given me beautiful moments and relationships because I was both vulnerable and confident. I
